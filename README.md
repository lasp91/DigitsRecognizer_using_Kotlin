# DigitsRecognizer_using_Kotlin
Original code is from the book "Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers" by Mathias Brandewinder

Taking a look at code from the referred book, I decided to experiment with the original code and also use different languages for comparison purposes, but getting the same results.
I basically created a new “Kotlin” code project based on the existing “F#” code.

Running the code is also possible to compare the execution time between the different projects.

The FVS2015 project is in: https://github.com/lasp91/DigitsRecognizer---Experiments-with-VS2015/blob/master/README.md
It also includes code for compiled F#, C++ (based on the original C# code) and a "Functional C++".
